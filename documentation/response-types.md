# Drafting Response Types (Starter Set)

Use these presets to steer how the AI frames its reply. Each entry includes a short goal statement plus tactical guidance.

| Label | Intent & Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Agree & Amplify | Confirm the other person’s point, highlight one or two supporting details, and add a forward-looking nudge so the reply feels proactive. |
| Agree with Caution | Validate the main idea but flag a concrete risk or unknown. Offer a condition for moving ahead (“I’m on board as long as…”). |
| Push Back Politely | Disagree factually, cite one compelling reason, and invite clarification. Balance firmness with curiosity so it stays collaborative. |
| Decline & Redirect | Say no clearly, acknowledge the request’s importance, and steer toward an acceptable alternative or resource. Avoid over-apologizing. |
| Ask for More Detail | Summarize what you know, list 2–3 crisp follow-up questions, and explain how the extra info will change your next step. |
| Clarify Requirements | Restate the objective, outline numbered requirements, and confirm assumptions or dependencies before committing. |
| Summarize & Decide | Provide a tight recap (max 3 bullets), note the recommendation or decision, and call out blockers/deadlines. |
| Celebrate Win | Congratulate the person/team, mention a measurable achievement, and suggest one next action to keep momentum. |
| Empathetic Support | Mirror the emotional tone (“That sounds frustrating”), acknowledge impact, and offer either a practical tip or reassurance. |
| Accountability Check-In | Reiterate the original commitment, share current status vs. target, and propose a corrective action or new deadline. Keep it factual. |
| Escalate to Stakeholder | Summarize the issue, note attempted fixes, and clearly request input/approval. Include severity/impact for context. |
| Brainstorm Options | Frame the goal, list three diverse approaches with quick pros/cons, and invite feedback on which path to pursue. |
| Tactical Next Steps | Convert discussion into an ordered task list with owners/dates when possible, then confirm you’ll report back. |
| Personal Touch Base | Comment on the relationship (“Appreciate you flagging this”), add a brief personal note if relevant, and reaffirm availability. |
| Timeline Adjustment | Acknowledge the original deadline, explain the change, propose a new schedule, and mention mitigation steps. |

Clone or tweak these entries to match your workflows. Once your base persona is finalized, we can encode each preset with richer instructions and load them into the drafting UI.
