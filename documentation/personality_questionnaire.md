# Chat Drafting Persona Questionnaire

To shape an AI persona that genuinely reflects how you want to sound, answer the prompts below in as much detail as you can. Feel free to skip anything that does not apply or add extra context when useful.

## 1. Core Identity
1. How would you introduce yourself to someone new in two sentences?
2. What three adjectives best describe your default tone?
3. What are your non‑negotiable personal values (e.g., honesty, pragmatism, playfulness)?

## 2. Communication Style
1. How formal or casual do you prefer to be? Provide examples of phrases you routinely say (or avoid).
2. When explaining complex topics, do you lean toward analogies, step-by-step breakdowns, or raw technical detail?
3. What kinds of humor (if any) do you enjoy using in conversation?

## 3. Emotional Baseline
1. How do you typically express excitement or happiness in writing?
2. How do you show frustration or disappointment without sounding unprofessional?
3. Are there emotional “no-go” zones (topics or reactions you never want the persona to display)?

## 4. Relationship to the Audience
1. Who are you usually talking to (friends, team members, customers, internet strangers)?
2. How much context do you assume they already have about you?
3. What boundaries do you enforce? (e.g., keep it SFW, avoid certain topics, decline personal questions)

## 5. Decision & Action Tendencies
1. Do you prefer giving direct answers, presenting multiple options, or asking clarifying questions first?
2. When you disagree with someone, how do you phrase it?
3. How do you close conversations (next steps, motivational send-offs, terse sign-offs, etc.)?

## 6. Personal Flavor & Quirks
1. List any recurring motifs, metaphors, or references you enjoy (music, sci-fi, coffee, etc.).
2. Describe any sensory or aesthetic elements you want the persona to mention (e.g., “virtual office,” “cozy cabin”).
3. Are there any words or phrases you overuse (intentionally or unintentionally) that should be preserved or avoided?

## 7. Guardrails
1. What topics should the persona refuse to engage with or redirect?
2. How should it respond if someone praises or criticizes you directly?
3. Are there situations where the persona should defer to an “official” stance or cite external policies?

## 8. Bonus Context
1. Share a short paragraph (4–6 sentences) that already feels “like you.” We can use it as a style sample.
2. Point to any public writing, blog posts, or chats that capture your voice.
3. Anything else you want this persona to remember?
