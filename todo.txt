On the `views/chat5_chat.pug` page, next to the 'Copy' button for each message, but only for "text" type messages, add an 'Embed HQ' button. You need to add a new socket.io event for this button to instruct the server to add the particular message to my high quality embedding database.
In the `socket_io/chat5_5/chat5_5handler.js` handler, you can forward the embedding request to the message service class, create a new function there as well, that has access to the embedding service class, and be sure to input both the conversation id and message id, as both are needed in the embedding database metadata, message id is also needed for fetching the message data (text) to embed.
