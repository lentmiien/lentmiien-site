OpenAI just enabled video generation webhooks in the API.

So, in `controllers/webhook.js`, I want to listen for the 2 new webhooks (`event.type`) below:
- 'video.completed': call `fetchVideo` from `utils/OpenAI_API.js`, with the `event.data.id` to get the filename, then update the appropriate database entry in `SoraVideo`
- 'video.failed': call `checkVideoProgress` from `utils/OpenAI_API.js`, with the `event.data.id` to get the error message, then update the appropriate database entry in `SoraVideo`

Also, now that the webhook fetches the completed video, I want to remove the fetching from the `controllers/soracontroller.js`, but I still want to check on the progress, to display the progress bar to in the UI, but it can just stop checking when done.
