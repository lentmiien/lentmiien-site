In `controllers/budget2controller.js`, I have a route (reviewTransactions) for displaying a review page to the user (views/budget_review.pug). Similarly to how I get receipt and payroll data in `BudgetService.getDashboardData()` for the budget dashboard, I want to get the same data for the specific period for the review page, and display for all transactions with the same date and amount, a link to the receipt or payroll data. I don't have a precise mapping, but it is very unusual that I have 2 transactions the same date, for the same amount, so matching date and amount is good enough for my use case.

Receipt URL: `/receipt/view_receipt/${receipt Id}`
Payroll URL: `/payroll/${payroll Id}`

While we are updating `views/budget_review.pug`, also make sure that the color scheme matches the description in `README-Colors.md`.
