I want to create a unified shopping list page, that gather data from 3 sources.

## Source 1: To Buy tasks
Entries from the `models/scheduleTask/Task.js` database, that has `type == "tobuy"` and `done == false` and `start` is either null or a date `<= today`.

## Source 2: Emergency stock
Go through all the categories in the `models/es_category.js` database, then subtract entries from the `models/es_item.js` database, and any categories with remaining `recommendedStock` should be displayed on the page.
Important note: `es_item` entries has an expiration date `rotateDate`, so if this date has passed, don't count that item. 

## Source 3: Cooking calendar
Show all entries from the `models/CookingCalendarV2.js` database where `date` is today or a future date (within 1 week)
Important note: make sure to fetch the `models/chat4_knowledge.js` database entries referenced to from the cooking database and display the `title` and `contentMarkdown` in the UI, the `contentMarkdown` include the ingredients list needed for the shopping list.

This page don't need to modify any database content, but I want the following interactivity (using browser local storage):
- When opening the page for the first time of the day, clear previous local storage, and set up local storage for this day
- When opening the page for the 2nd+ time of the day, review the sources to add any new content, and delete sources that was removed/completed
- Any added content should be marked as "not done" initially, then the user can click on the entries to toggle "done"/"not done" (in local storage only)

Now, add a new route/controller, and necessary pages, CSS/JavaScript in the `public` folder, following the color scheme outlined in `documentation/README-Colors.md`.
