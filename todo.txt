On the `views/chat5_chat.pug` page, I want to add a voice input mode. It can be something like, user press the button, speak, then press the button again, then the audio is uploaded to the server, transcribed, returned to the user, and appended to the prompt input text field.
Add the button near the input field, appropriate socket.io events in `socket_io/chat5_5/chat5_5handler.js`, and use the transcription API to extract the text from the audio.

Please refer to the code in `controllers/asrcontroller.js`, for details on the transcription API, at URL 'http://192.168.0.20:8010'.
Maybe you could mode the API code to a new service class in the 'services' folder, for easier reusing and maintaining the code, etc.
