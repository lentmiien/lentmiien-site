At the `views/ocr_tool.pug` page, when putting together the 'Layout text' output, I've noticed that the algorithm we are currently using is rather inaccurate, but when I look at the bounding boxes overlayed on the image, they are arranged so neatly, that I can't understand how the 'Layout text' output get to be that inaccurate. We should be able to do much better, with just a few simple rules.

Rule 1: if the Y overlap of 2 text entries is less than half of the height of both entries, then the entries are on separate rows
Rule 2: if on the same row, then the order (left to right) can be determined by ordering in increasing start X coordinates of the 2 entries (there can be more than 2 entries per row)
Rule 3: when combining entries that are on the same row, just put a double space '  ' in-between the entries and combine the strings

I'm mostly using nicely oriented images, so these rules should work well for my use case.

Please update the algorithm for putting together the 'Layout text' output.
