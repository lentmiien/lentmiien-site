Can we re-purpose the embedding test page (views/admin_embedding_test.pug), to an embedding management page?

I want to be able to search the embedding database as usual (normal and high quality), and maybe view a list of all embeddings generated the last 24 hours (normal and high quality), for manually deleting entries that I don't need, or mistakenly added. So on the search list, add a delete embedding function, and add a list of recently added embeddings, with delete functionality.

Be sure to group embeddings that belong to the same data entry, text chunks that all belonging to the exact same 'Source' and 'Parent'.
