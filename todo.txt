The OpenAI batches API don't support tool usage, or at least not web search and image generation, so I need to avoid setting any tools in the requests in `services/batchService.js`. However, I don't plan to enforce that tools must be deleted from conversations before using the batch service, so just ignore any tools set, when processing requests in the batch service. Also, to make the user aware of the limitations, show a warning message in the UI (views/chat5_chat.pug) under or near the batch processing buttons that tools are unsuported by the batches API and will be ignored, but only display the warning if the user has selected one or more tools.
