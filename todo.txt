In `views/image_gen/index.pug` and `public/js/image_gen.js`, I generate an input form for the selected workflow. Up to now, I've only had "text-to-image" and "1_image-to-image" workflows, but I've recently added a "2_images-to-image" workflow (that could even be extended to 3 images), but the upload image only upload to the first image, and when browsing input/output images and click "Use for img2img" it can only set the image to the first image, is there any simple way to get these functions to work with multiple input images? Maybe use the first image as default (current functionality), and add an expand button that shows all image input options?
Also, for the input image fields, it would be nice with a simple auto-complete function, that can auto-complete to the filenames in the input folder (as only existing filenames are valid values for this field).

Also, for the prompt library modal, I'd like to have a free text filter function, to easier find entries based on a key word/phrase. It doesn't need to be anything complicated, just see if the free text string value is part of the prompt text.
