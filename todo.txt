The TTS URL has the following changes:

* Base URL (unchanged): `http://192.168.0.20:8080`
* Generate TTS audio: `/tts/openaudio`
* Get list of available voice ids: `/tts/openaudio/references/list`

Please update `services/ttsService.js` to use these new URLs.

For the available voice ids, call the endpoint at start up, and save to a variable in memory (cache), then create an update cache function, and get cached list function.

This is an example of a response from `/tts/openaudio/references/list`:
```
{"success":true,"reference_ids":["anny_en","anny_jp","lennart_en","lennart_jp","popok_en"],"message":"Found 5 reference voices"}
```
