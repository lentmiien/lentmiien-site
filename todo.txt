For the OCR tool, `controllers/ocrcontroller.js`, I want to switch to saving jobs to a database instead. So add a new database for this, then update the controller and UI to work with this database.

Use the full size uploaded image for the OCR job, but save a copy to the folder `public/ocr`, that will be used in the UI, or if forwarding the image somewhere else in the app, but resize this copy so that the longest side has a max length of 2048 pixels, keep the aspect ratio, and save as a JPG file with bit compression to keep the files relatively small, using the `sharp` library.

In the UI, display a list of OCR jobs from the last 7 days, and the possibility to go back in time to check older jobs. When opening a job, keep a similar UI to what's currently shown, and allow for the user to manually edit the OCR texts, if edits are need, including removing unnecessary OCR text pieces, and save the changes to the database. Note: do not update the job date when editing an entry, so if I edit an entry from a month ago, it should not appear in the last 7 days list.

Also, in the UI, only load the database data, from the last 7 days, when loading the page (no images), then when the user select a job, add the `public/ocr` image to the UI with the OCR overlay, and textboxes, etc. similar to the current layout.

We'll keep the OCR database content indefinitely, but the user can manually delete entries if needed, when deleting an entry, also delete the image copy in `public/ocr`, this copy is only intended for the OCR tool, and if the image is used elsewhere, it should be copied to the appropriate location for that tool (and resized if necessary).
