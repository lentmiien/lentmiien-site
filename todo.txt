On the page `views/admin_ai_gateway.pug`, there is a "Largest VRAM jumps" table in the "LLM Throughput & VRAM" section. This table works great for showing the max VRAM usage for the 'cydonia:24b-q6' model that I use, but no other models show up because the models are smaller. Please change this to show the top 5 VRAM usage for each model.
The "Largest VRAM jumps" table shows very useful information, so I really want to know the same data for all local LLM models I use.
