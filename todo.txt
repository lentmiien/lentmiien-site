In the bulk tool in `controllers/image_gen.controller.js`, I want to add 2 new image rating system, added to the `models/bulk_test_prompt.js` database. And also add a slideshow view for images with missing ratings (only the 2 new system).

Rating system 1:
A simple 0-5 scale rating of defects in the image.
* 0 has no defects (essentially a real photo, or image in the given style)
* 1 has no apparent defects (the same as 0 but used for AI generated images)
* 2 has minimal to almost no defects, not noticeable at a quick glance
* 3 has some defects, nothing too severe, may look a bit odd, and easy to spot
* 4 has clear defects, and the image isn't very useful
* 5 has major defects, somewhat disturbing, and I don't want to look at the image again

Rating system 2:
A "followed the prompt" rating system, ranging from 1-5, for each part of the prompt. Where 1 indicate that almost nothing from the prompt is in the image, to 5 indicating that everything from the prompt is in the image.
* part 0 is everything except the placeholder values
* part 1-n is each placeholder value
* part n+1 is negative prompt (if used)

In the new slide show UI, we could show an image, and the 2 new rating systems, with a simple input UI for quick ratings.

From rating system 1, I expect we can filter out bad images, by hiding 4-5 ratings, or even 2-3 for finding the best of the best, and from system 2, I expect to learn what kind of words and phrases that work well with the specific model used.

Together with the existing rating system, of how good I think the images are and how well they compare to other images in the batch, I should be able to find my favorite great images from a combination of the existing system and the new system 1, and combining this with the new system 2, I should be able to find prompt elements for generating more great images to my liking.

Please add these 2 new rating system to the bulk workflow, and add the slideshow page to actually rate the images.
