Please add a new route and route controller, for uploading temporary files to the "tmp_data/" folder, and view a list of all files in the same folder, with download option.
The intention is for transfering smaller files, like up to 10MB at most, and as we are using the "tmp_data/" folder, the content is periodically deleted, so it's just for temporary use.
This route should require `isAuthenticated` and `isAdmin`, and should accept any types of files.

Use a modern minimalistic style for the UI, and create the necessary PUG templates and JavaScript files, do not put JavaScript inline in the PUG template.
