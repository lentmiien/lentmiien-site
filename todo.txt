I've added more voices and simplified the TTS API, so please update the TTS service class (services/ttsService.js) to handle the following new API interface:

Base URL "http://192.168.0.20:8080" stays the same.

## Endpoints

1. GET `/tts/voices`: return a list of all available voices, currently return:
```
{"default_voice":"piper_en","voices":[{"voice_id":"piper_en","backend":"wyoming_piper","display_name":"Piper English (en_US-lessac-medium)","language":"en"},{"voice_id":"piper_sv","backend":"wyoming_piper","display_name":"Piper Swedish (sv_SE-nst-medium)","language":"sv"},{"voice_id":"ja_shikoku_metan_normal","backend":"voicevox","display_name":"Shikoku Metan Normal","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"ja_shikoku_metan_amaama","backend":"voicevox","display_name":"Shikoku Metan AmaAma","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"ja_shikoku_metan_tsuntsun","backend":"voicevox","display_name":"Shikoku Metan Tsuntsun","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"ja_shikoku_metan_sexy","backend":"voicevox","display_name":"Shikoku Metan Sexy","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"ja_shikoku_metan_sasayaki","backend":"voicevox","display_name":"Shikoku Metan Sasayaki","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"ja_shikoku_metan_hisohiso","backend":"voicevox","display_name":"Shikoku Metan Hisohiso","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"ja_zundamon_sexy","backend":"voicevox","display_name":"Zundamon Sexy","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"ja_kyushu_sora_sexy","backend":"voicevox","display_name":"Kyushu Sora Sexy","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"anny_en","backend":"openaudio","display_name":"OpenAudio (anny_en clone)","language":"en"},{"voice_id":"anny_jp","backend":"openaudio","display_name":"OpenAudio (anny_jp clone)","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"lennart_en","backend":"openaudio","display_name":"OpenAudio (lennart_en clone)","language":"en"},{"voice_id":"lennart_jp","backend":"openaudio","display_name":"OpenAudio (lennart_jp clone)","language":"ja"},{"voice_id":"popok_en","backend":"openaudio","display_name":"OpenAudio (popok_en clone)","language":"en"},{"voice_id":"openaudio_default","backend":"openaudio","display_name":"OpenAudio (no reference)","language":"en"}]}
```

2. POST `/tts`: Generate a TTS audio file, based on `voice_id` and input `text`, no additional parameters are needed or used (other necessary data is generated inside the API)
Example `curl` request:
```
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.20:8080/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"voice_id":"piper_en","text":"Hello. This is the fast English TTS voice."}' \
  --output out_en.wav
```

So, simplify the service class, based on this updated API interface.

Note: `openaudio` voice cloning is very slow, but support custom set up voices, `wyoming_piper` or `voicevox` is recommended for most daily use.

The service class should have a way of fetching and caching a list of the available voices, return to user when requested for, and generate TTS audio. If generate is called with an unknown voice id, try to re-cache the voice list once and check again, if the voice still doesn't exist, return a meaningful error.

I'll also need to update any tools using the TTS, to fetch the voice list, and simplify generation requests to only include the voice id and input text.
