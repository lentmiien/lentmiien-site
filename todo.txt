On the `views/chat5_chat.pug` page, I have a TTS function, that auto calculate tokens to 1024 per 500 character input. This works great for English, but isn't enough for Japanese, where I roughly need the double. I'm currently naming my reference ids with the 2 letter language code at the end, example 'lennart_en' for English, and 'lennart_jp' for Japanese, so can we use this to auto set double tokens for Japanese. Also, when not using a reference id, can we add a check box, for the user to manually select "double tokens (recommended for Japanese)"?
