The ComfyUI server app was updated to handle video files, so please update the image generating router (routes/image_gen.js), controller (controllers/image_gen.controller.js), and UI (views/image_gen/*.pug) to handle video generations as well. Please cache videos to the folder `public/video`, for quicker access, and display a video player when the video is completed. Rating the prompts and the prompt library, shouldn't be any different, for the new video workflows. Lets just create one combined router/controller for both image and video generation. Be sure to add the "video" folder as an option for checking generated content.

Please refer to `ComfyUI_server_changes.md` for a detailed description of the changes.

Also, make sure to follow the color scheme described in `README-Colors.md`, for the UI.
