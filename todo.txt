I've added a second embedding API, at the local URL 'http://192.168.0.20:8002', this time a more capable and larger model, please add this as a second embedding API in `services/embeddingApiService.js`. I need both the APIs, the smaller for quicker performance for "everything data" that I track, and the larger for selected high quality data. So I need a second embedding database for use with this higher quality knowledge database.

The database structure can be exactly the same as `models/vector_embedding.js`, or maybe we can use the same database with embedding model filtering.

This new API will essentially have 2 use cases:
1. Similar to existing API but for selected more high quality data, and better embedding performance
2. Re-rank results from the smaller embedding model, by fetches all original data from the smaller embedding search, re-embed with larger embedding model, and return top re-ranked results

So I essentially need the embed and re-embed functions for the new API, and 2 new search functions, one for the new API, and one for the combined search.

Important, the API interface is nearly identical to the previous API, but with an additional input parameter at the `/embed` endpoint, `task` than can be either "document" or "query", with "document" as default when no value is provided. "document" used for normal embedding tasks, "query" used for embedding queries, for better performance.

Responses from the new API is in exactly the same format as the small embedding model.

At the page `views/admin_embedding_test.pug`, add a select box for selecting search type, for testing.
