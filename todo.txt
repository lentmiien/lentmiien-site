In my AI Gateway, I've added 2 new routes:

1. GET `/comfy/auto_stop`: Check current settings, returns:  
```
{
  "enabled": true,
  "idle_timeout_sec": 300.0,
  "docker_available": true,
  "container_state": "exited"
}
```

2. POST `/comfy/auto_stop`: Enable/Disable auto-stop policy  
The POST endpoint takes the following input (example):
```
{
  "enabled": false
}
```

Please wire up these endpoints to the `views/admin_ai_gateway.pug` page, to show the current status and add a toggle switch to enable/disable the auto-stop policy; also add additional functionality in the admin route (routes/admin.js) / controller (controllers/admincontroller.js) to support the new functionality.
