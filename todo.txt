On the `views/image_gen/index.pug` page, I currently show a "Edit workflow JSON", for directly edit the workflow JSON before sending of to ComfyUI to generate the output. I'd like to change this as following:
* Keep the JSON editor, but turn into a viewer only, and maybe hide behind a popup ("View JSON")
* Add a customizable UI
    * Show a select box that list all nodes, and sub data labels (that has a value)
    * User select a node + label, click make editable, to reveal an input field in the UI (can be set as string or number, and one UI element can optionally be specified as "prompt" [make text area instead of input], input default values are set to the values in the original JSON file) *Use the "prompt" UI element for rating/embeddings
    * The users choices are saved to the browser local storage, for the selected workflow, so when the same workflow is selected again, the same UI inputs are shown
* When pressing generate, the app replaces the values in the JSON object with the values in the UI inputs, and send updated JSON to the server
