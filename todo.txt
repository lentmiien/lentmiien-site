The `models/message_inbox.js` database has a `retentionDeadlineDate` date field. In the `setup.js` script, delete all database entries that has expired. Also, if either or both of `hasEmbedding` and `hasHighQualityEmbedding` are `true`, then the corresponding embeddings should also be deleted, maybe it's easiest to do the deletion through the `services/embeddingApiService.js` service class.
