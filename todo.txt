The 'views/admin_music_test.pug' page that I added is working really great. Next, I'd like to bring this function as a regular tool on my page, with it's own route (routes) and controller (controllers), and build an AI music library.

So, adding a database for saving music generation metadata, with my preference ratings for each generation, and the new user page (on it's own route).

What I want this page to be able to do is:
* Generate a music audio file (similar to the current admin page)
* Allow me to rate the music (newly generated and playback from music library)
* Infinity player (play random music files from my library on an infinite loop, with option to specify "above xx rating", and a toggle for allowing unrated music to be included)
* AI assisted prompting, using `utils/OpenAI_API.js`, I want to prompt the OpenAI `gpt-5.2-2025-12-11` model to generate a "caption", "lyrics", "vocal_language" and "duration (seconds)", returned as structured output, sent to the music generator (with other values set to current default values), as input to the AI prompt, I also want to input 2-3 random examples from my highest rated previous generations, and instructions to generate a similar but different music prompt for a new generation
* Lets rate music from 0-5, where 0 is garbage (delete from music library), 1 is bad but keep, 2 is OK, 3 is good, 4 is great, 5 is awesome
* In music library, lets save last played time stamp, and when randomly playing (Infinity player), do a weighted random that favour higher rated music, and not recenetly played, and if "allowing unrated music" is enabled, those music should also have higher priority
* When playing the "Infinity player", do new generations in the background, adding to the music library when done, so the music can be randomly selected when the next music is played
* When not playing the "Infinity player", auto-play newly generated music audios when done

Now create this new tool!
