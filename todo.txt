I have the page `views/cooking_statistics.pug` showing some basic statistics of recipies in my cookbook.

I'd like to create a page that shows a "recommended to cook next" list, importantly:
1. I want to hide all "Cooked last 10 days" entries from this list
2. Anything cooked over 1 month ago, or never cooked ("Not recorded"), should be prioritized
3. Entries with higher "Total" numbers, should have a slightly higher priority (reach max priority at 25 entries)
4. There should be a randomize button, and the list should be randomized when page is opened, based on the above priorities

So, when opening the page, or pressing the randomize button, I should see a list with more higher priority cookbook entries at the top, but still randomized for some variation.

The priority should feel something like, things that I haven't cooked in a while, and "good" recipies (with many occurrences), should appear more near the top.

Also show some basic statistics for each entry, that I can use as guidance when deciding on what to cook next.

Create the new page, and link to the page from the `views/cooking_index.pug` page, by adding a link button near the "View statistics" button.
