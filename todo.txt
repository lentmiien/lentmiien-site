At the `views/chat5_chat.pug`, I want to add a new tool for using AI to draft input prompts. In the end, I want the function to work roughly as following:

1. User open the chat they want to respond on, then they select a personality (prepared and saved to a new personality database), and select a response type (like "agree", "reject", "ask for more details", etc.), and optionally write some notes in the prompt field, and press a new "Draft prompt" button. (Put the new UI elements next to the template selector, after some divider element)
2. The conversation id, together with the input data is sent to the server, where it go through the conversation and message services, to generate a draft prompt for the user. (Basically, the context message will be replaced with the personality text, response type and instructions for the AI to generate a draft response for the conversation, and the instructions will be repeated in a user message appended to the conversation, that also include the notes if provided, and the model should always use the `ollama` AI model "cydonia-24b-q4_k_m:latest" when drafting these responses, nothing should be saved to any database during this drafting workflow, and the generated response should simply be returned to the user and inserted in the prompt field)
3. The user review the message, optionally edit the message, and append it to the conversation as a normal chat message (using existing functionality)

Please add this new tool to the chat interface, and also add a page for managing personalities and response types, and add 2 new databases for storing the data.

While waiting for the draft to be generated, display the "Loading" overlay, as it can take a bit of time to get a response.

Add new events to the socket.io instance, for this new tool.

Also, in the UI, lets cache the selected options in the browser, so that when the page is reloaded, or open a new chat, the most recently selected personality and response type is selected by default.
