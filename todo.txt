In `public/js/chat5_5.js` when adding a message to the UI, please add a small button in the upper right corner of the `messageWrapper`, that blend into the UI (isn't very visible), for copying the raw text content, but only for entries that have text content in either of the following data fields, in the following priority:
1. `m.content.text`
2. `m.content.transcript`
3. `m.content.revisedPrompt`
4. `m.content.toolOutput`

Also do the same changes in `views/chat5_chat.pug`, so that opening existing conversations also have this functionality.
