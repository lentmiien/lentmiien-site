I want to look at transition my "chat5_5" to a VUE app I have. The communication with the server is currently done through Socket.io in `socket_io/chat5_5/chat5_5handler.js`, so mostly I should just be able to design a UI in my VUE app that uses the same Socket.io interface, but I need a way of fetching my conversation history as well, currently done when loading the top page in the function `view_chat5_top` in the file `controllers/chat5controller.js`.

So, I'm thinking of adding functions to the socket.io interface for loading conversation history from a given updated date interval. Please add this functionality to `socket_io/chat5_5/chat5_5handler.js`.

Next, create a new file `socket_io/chat5_5/chat5_5_documentation.md`, that explain the socket.io interface in great details, for use to develop the UI interface in VUE. For reference, check my current implementation in `views/chat5_chat.pug` and give a rough overview of the current UI, not for creating a copy in VUE, but to serve as a starting point of designing an even better UI in VUE.
For example, I want some way of hiding/collapsing messages in long conversations, and some way of always keeping the input text field nearby when scrolling through conversations, and easy/quick access to certain settings, etc. but these are points for the VUE development, so don't make any changes to the current implementation, other than adding functionality to the socket.io interface, for making it possible to transition.

Now, prepare the socket.io interface for the transition, and create the documentation file.
