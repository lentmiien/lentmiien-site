I'm satisfied with the embedding testing page `views/admin_embedding_test.pug`, so now I wish to move this to a new route, for all logged in users to access, but only the search interface.

So create the search page, display a search bar on the `views/mypage.pug` page, and when the user makes a search, do the search and show the search page with the search results.

Lets show 50 search results, and include the links to the original data, as we currently do on the test page.
