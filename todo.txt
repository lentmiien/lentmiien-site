In `views/chat5_chat.pug` there is a draft prompt tool with a small form for selecting personality, response type, and write some prompt notes (optional). The tool itself works as intended, but I want to make the input form more compact. At the same time, if we could make the template tool a bit more compact as well that would be great, and just push the 2 tools a bit closer together, as the tools are very similar in that they both put content in the input text area.
