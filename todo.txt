I want to connect the `controllers/ocrcontroller.js` and `controllers/receiptcontroller.js` in the following way:

First, I want to make the 'Layout text' output editable in the OCR tool, for manually correcting any errors before proceeding to the next step.

Once I've completed an OCR job of receipts, and possible corrected any OCR errors, I want to have a button for sending the receipts (all receipts in the OCR job) to the receipt controller. Normally the receipt controller only need the images (that are then resized and saved to the appropriate folder), but additionally I now want to include the OCR 'Layout text'. So in the receipt controller, and the receipt database, I want to add support for this additional text field. Also, when sending the receipt image and text instructions to the OpenAI API, I want to include the OCR text, for further improving the response accuracy.

Both the OCR tool and receipt tool can handle multiple image uploads, so my typical use case will be to upload 1 or more receipts to the OCR tool, then forward all the receipts to the receipt tool when the OCR is done, but this step is done manually, as I may need to correct the 'Layout text', and not all the OCR I do are receipts.

If, in case, I were to upload any receipts directly to the receipt tool in the future (skip the OCR tool), then I want to leave the 'Layout text' in the receipt database empty.

Make sure that 'Layout text' appear when previewing receipts, and can also be edited if necessary, as any other data in the receipt tool.
