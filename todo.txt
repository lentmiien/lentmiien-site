In `services/embeddingApiService.js`, when doing the `similaritySearch`, I'd like to process entries of the source 'chat_message' as following:
After ranking the original array on similarity, and removed all duplicate text chunks from the same entry, I'd like to combine all 'chat_message' that has the same 'conversation' id, to the highest ranked result, maybe we can put the preview texts and similarity scores in an 'alternative_sources' array, so the UI could display these texts if needed. Also, when removing the 'chat_message' from the same 'conversation', we can fill up the return array with the next ranked items, to reach the target number of search hits.
