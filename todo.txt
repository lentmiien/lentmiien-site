On the accounting dashboard (views/accounting_dashboard.pug), I have a "Spend by category" horizontal bar chart, where I'd like to make the following changes:
1. Show the chunk of the "Bills" category (`_id: "63a082ef4796a649f99264d2"`), with `transaction_business` as "Credit Card" in a different color, as a stacked bar chart, as this is really a combination of other stuff, that really belongs to various categories
2. Show a second horizontal bar chart, showing the credit card transactions by Label, for the current month (use the same color as above, to match up the colors)

Note: The "Bills" - "Credit Card" group could have payments originating from the previous month, so there is no guarantee that this amount will match the total of the second bar chart, but that's fine, because that's just the way it is.
