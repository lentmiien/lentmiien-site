When using the `views/chat5_chat.pug` page (chatting), it's quite often the case that I send a message to summarize an ongoing conversation, and I may continue the conversation after that, or I may simply regret a certain message I sent. In these cases, I have to open the "Raw" tab and either mark the messages as "Hide from bot", or remove the Message ids (if I don't want to keep the messages in the conversation). *Both of these actions only work after reloading the page, so it's a bit anoying.
Since this is a rather common thing to do, I'd like to add 2 new buttons in the UI, "Hide last message" and "Remove last message".

"Hide last message" should find the last message in the conversation where `hideFromBot` is `false` and change this to `true`.

"Remove last message" should find the second last message in the conversation where `hideFromBot` is `false` and remove all message ids after that, so in other word, remove the last visible message, and all hidden messages before that.

There is no need to delete the messages from the message database, as I allow for users to manually append messages to other conversations, so the message could be used elsewhere.
