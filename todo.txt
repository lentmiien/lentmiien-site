In the PUG template `views/chat5_chat.pug` I have the button `button.btn.btn-success(onclick="") Update`, that has not yet been implemented.
Please help me implement this button, to simply update the conversation parameters, but it should only work for entries from the `conversation5.js` database, if loading a `conversation4.js` conversation, the button can remain disabled. Lets also expose the `maxMessages` database field in the UI, to set the cutoff for long conversations.

Also, I'd like to enable creating a conversation summary, similarly as creating a conversation title through AI, something like the `button.btn.btn-warning(onclick="GenerateTitle()") AI Generate` button on the same page, but for generating a summary. Create the necessary backend functionality to support this functionality and add the button to the UI. I'd like to use the OpenAI model `gpt-4.1-mini` for generating the summaries, ignore images, and generate summaries based on the text messages that aren't hidden from the bot.
