I've updated the embedding API to include the exact text strings that were used to generate the vector embedding in the response, so an example response no looks like this:

```
{
  "model": "sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2",
  "dim": 768,
  "vectors": [
    "[redacted array vectors.0: 768 elements]"
  ],
  "chunks": [
    {
      "text_index": 0,
      "chunk_index": 0,
      "start_token": 0,
      "end_token": 1,
      "text": "Test"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that in each chunk there is now a `text` field, this is the string that generated the specific vector embedding for the particular chunk.

Please update the embedding service class (services/embeddingApiService.js), to use this returned string for the `previewText` in the database. So remove the previous code for estimating the preview text, and replace with the text returned from the API.
