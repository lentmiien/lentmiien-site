Please help me to update imgen to work with the updated API specifications in `documentation/comfyui-new-api-documentation.md`.

Note: Keep bulk processing unavailable for now.

Update router (routes/image_gen.js) and controller (controllers/image_gen.controller.js) code, as well as user page (views/image_gen/index.pug) as necessary, to create a job, then poll for status updates until done.

While the `/comfy/submit` endpoint can take a "workflow_id" or a "prompt", only implement the "prompt" solution; the prompt is the workflow JSON object. ("workflow_id" will generate the same image every time, same input data every time, so not useful for me)
