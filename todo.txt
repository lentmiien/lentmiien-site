I need to do something about my API debug logger saving large data object to my database, quickly blowing up the database collections to many GB in size.

First, I'm redeclaring the function `recordApiDebugLog` in multiple files, could we break this out to an utility function in the `utils` folder, then we'll make this function scan through the request and response bodies (if provided), and replace any large sized values with a short descriptive string. For example, if nested inside the request body, there is an image or two in BASE64 encoding, just replace the value (BASE64 encoded image) with a string saying something like "xxx bytes string", or if there is a data array with many thousands of entries, replace the array with a string saying something like "xxx elements data array", etc.

Make the threshold values tunable at the top of the utility file, and also include some custom redaction settings, for example, if a certain Object path exist (if `data.data` exist), replace with a value (set `data.data = "Custom redact string"`), so that I can manually add redactions as necessary, for things that aren't triggered by any data threshold redactions.
