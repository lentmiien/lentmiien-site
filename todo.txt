I've noticed that the `views/ocr_tool.pug` page is very slow. It seems like it re-download all the job data every 5 seconds, including the image data, which quickly grows to several tens of MB, and it never finished downloading all the data in 5 seconds, so the re-downloads build up, and slow down the page.
Can we do some cashing of completed jobs on the user side, and maybe slow down the update interval to 10 seconds, or 5 seconds after last update complete?
