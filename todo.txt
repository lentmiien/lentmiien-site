On the page 'views/asr_tool.pug', add a model selector, than can have the values "whisper-api" or "vibevoice-asr". The selected model should be included in the API request to my AI Gateway, which is handled in the service class 'services/asrApiService.js'. "whisper-api" should be the default option, and be used if the user hasn't provided a model, "vibevoice-asr" is the new model. The new model has the additional capability of naming speakers, so works well for multi-speaker audio. The new model also has the additional/optional parameters `sampling_rate`, `max_new_tokens`, `hotwords`, `context`, so please add input fields for these parameters as well, but it doesn't use any of the existing "whisper-api" parameters, but all parameters can be sent to the gateway server, the gateway server uses the valid parameters for the selected model, but don't include empty values, to select server default values.
