In `controllers/mypagecontroller.js`, I have the route controller functions `pdf_to_jpg` and `convert_pdf_to_jpg` for handling a PDF to JPG converter. The conversion works well, but the page design isn't that great, as I just quickly put it together to make the page usable. So, please help me update the PUG templates `views/pdf_to_jpg.pug` and `views/pdf_to_jpg_output.pug` with a modern minimalistic design.

Also, I'd like the output to display nicely on both large and small screens, and make it visible where one page ends and the next starts, just a minimal visible indicator.

Also, when viewing a converted PDF file, I often find my self scrolling down, and then I need to convert the next file, so I need to scroll up again, so it would be nice if the "upload next file" form could stay sticky to the top or bottom of the screen, for easy access.
