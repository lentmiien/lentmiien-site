In the OCR tool, on the `views/ocr_tool.pug` page, add a button for every OCR image in the displayed job, to add the layout text to the high quality embedding database, `embedHighQuality` in `services/embeddingApiService.js`, using the same metadata as the normal embedding. So I can choose exactly which data to save in the high quality database. If a job included 2+ images, I can choose to only embed 1 image to the high quality if I want.

Note: the normal embedding should continue work as previously, with no changes.
