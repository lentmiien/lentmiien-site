In the embedding search tool that I'm currently testing, at the page `views/admin_embedding_test.pug`, I'd like to return at most 1 search hit per unique data entry, so if for example a certain knowledge entry has 2+ text chunks in the top N results, I only want to display the first (top) entry, and just leave place for other entries below, instead of consuming multiple spots.

If both the Source and Parent metadata are identical, then it's the same entry, but if either of the values differ, then count is as a unique entry.

While we are at it, I'd also like to add a date filter to the search, it can default at "all time", but allow the user to specify a start and end date, that filter the updated date of the embedding database entry.
