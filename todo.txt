I want to create an admin page for managing the content in the `public/html` folder. Create a new route(routes/admin.js)/controller(controllers/admincontroller.js) for a page that can do the following 3 things:
- Admin user can input a filename, and an HTML page in as text in a textarea element, and upload to the server, that then create the file in the `public/html` folder
- Admin user can input a filename, and select an HTML file, and upload to the server, that then create the file in the `public/html` folder
- Admin user can view a list of all files in the `public/html` folder, and click to delete files that are no longer needed

For the PUG template, please follow the coloring guidelines in `README-Colors.md`, create a simplistic modern style page, and don't put any JavaScript code inline in the template file.
