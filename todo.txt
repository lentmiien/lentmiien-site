For the OCR tool (controllers/ocrcontroller.js), create a page for displaying a single job, by receiving a job id in the URL, and displaying a page with only that job. The controls and edit capabilities should be the same as when displaying a job on the OCR tool top page (views/ocr_tool.pug), and make sure to update the embedding database if `layoutText` is edited. Also, optionally, the URL can also include a file id, if that's the case, highlight the specific file on the page.
