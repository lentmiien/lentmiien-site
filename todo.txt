I want to create an API debugging database. That store request-response pairs of raw data in a temporary database, lets say for 5 days. First create a new database schema, then starting with `utils/OpenAI_API.js`, log the request and response raw data for all API calls to the database. Of the available data, store "request URL", request and response HTTP headers, request and response body (if a GET request just store the value `null`), lets also store the JavaScript file name, and the function name where the request was called. If any values are unknown, for example if the API calls are done in a wrapper library, then store the wrapper object path instead of URL, skip HTTP headers, and store the input/output as the "body".

To achieve 5 days data retention, in the `setup.js` script, delete entries over 5 days old.

Also, to make this logging more useful, create a new admin page in route (routes/admin.js) and controller (controllers/admincontroller.js), to view all log entries, in a modern minimalistic design, following the coloring specifications in `README-Colors.md`. Make sure to include filtering on "JavaScript file name" and "function name", to make it easier to find specific API calls.

Also write a short documentation for the database, in `documentation/api-debug-database.md` (create the file), to explain the usage of the database, for reference when adding logging to other places in my code.
