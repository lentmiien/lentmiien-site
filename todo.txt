In my "sora" route (routes/sora.js) and controller (controllers/soracontroller.js), and the UI (views/sora.pug), I want to add an optional input image. If the user don't specify any image, the app should continue working as before, but if the user specifies an input image, temporary save the uploaded image to the `tmp_data` folder, then in `utils/OpenAI_API.js`, when using the `generateVideo` function, the image should be inserted, as a `file` in the `input_reference` parameter to the OpenAI API. So you need to add an input parameter to the function, but only set `input_reference` if there is a valid input. Important: the `input_reference` image must have the same size as the `size` parameter for the video, so also resize the image using the `sharp` library, before sending it to the API.

OpenAI only provide example code for curl, so convert the code below to JavaScript, and update my code to work with input images, if an image has been provided:
```
curl -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/videos" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F prompt="She turns around and smiles, then slowly walks out of the frame." \
  -F model="sora-2-pro" \
  -F size="1280x720" \
  -F seconds="8" \
  -F input_reference="@sample_720p.jpeg;type=image/jpeg"
```
Note: the existing code already handles 'prompt', 'model', 'size', and 'seconds'. So what I need is to add an optional image input to my existing code.

I think this is how to create the file object: `const input_reference = await OpenAI.toFile(fs.createReadStream(inImage), null, { type: "image/jpeg" });`.

While we are reviewing the sora video generator tool, also update the color scheme to match the description in `README-Colors.md`.
