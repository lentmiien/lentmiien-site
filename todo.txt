Create a test page, in the admin route, that shows a page to the user for my new TTS API at "http://192.168.0.20:8080". The UI should show a text input box, and a reference_id select box, that can be empty for now (did not yet prepare any reference data). When the user submit the request, connect to the API to generate the audio, then save the audio file in `public/temp`, please refer to the python sample code in `documentation/test.py` for a simple example of how to send the request.

When the audio is done, display a simple audio player, to the user, to play the generated audio.

Also, in the UI, display this list of special keywords, for the user to know what they can use to modify emotions/tone/etc.:
