I've just added an AI gateway for my AI models. The gateway URL is `http://192.168.0.20:8080`.

Now, for my Embedding service, I want to switch from directly accessing the APIs to instead go through the gateway.

The normal embedding URL therefore changes to `http://192.168.0.20:8080/embed/mpnet`, and the high quality embedding URL changes to `http://192.168.0.20:8080/embed/nomic`.

Please update the `services/embeddingApiService.js` service class, to work with these new URLs, the payload stays the same.
