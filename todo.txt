In my API route (routes/api.js), I'd like to add 2 posting routes, that does the same things as the 2 buttons "Send & Response" and "Batch Send & Response" on the `views/chat5_chat.pug` page. The UI that will be using the API will have a `textarea` for input text and a conversation ID selector, so it won't handle any settings parameters, or creating new conversations, and is only a stripped down/simplified post to chat tool.

"Send & Response" should be something similar to the 'chat5-append' socket.io event in `socket_io/chat5_5/chat5_5handler.js`, but a bit simplified as it'll only ever post to existing conversations, and don't need edit any settings; `generateAI` should be `true`. (use settings from existing conversation if needed)

Similarly "Batch Send & Response" should be something similar to the 'chat5-batch' socket.io event in `socket_io/chat5_5/chat5_5handler.js`.

The API, for both endpoints, only need to acknowledge receipt of the request, and maybe respond with an error if the user did not provide any input text, or the conversation didn't exist.
