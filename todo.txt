On the `views/knowledge_list.pug` page, I want to add a button, at the bottom, for embedding/re-embedding all the content in the knowledge database.

Use the embedding service class (services/embeddingApiService.js) and embed all entries with both `embed` and `embedHighQuality`, including metadata for the knowledge database.

Please refer to the OCR tool (controllers/ocrcontroller.js), for how I to use the embedding service class.

For each knowledge entry, concatinate the `title`, `contentMarkdown`, `category` and `tags`, into a single string, and pass that as the string to embed, for both normal and high quality embeddings. Embed each knowledge entry one by one.

Going forward, whenever a new knowledge entry is created, or an existing is updated, embed/re-embed that entry every time there is a change, with both normal and high quality embedding. So also update existing logic to call the embedding class when something is saved to the knowledge database.
