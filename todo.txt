In the app I have the route (routes/product_details.js) and controller (controllers/productdetailscontroller.js), that I'd like to expose in my API (controllers/apicontroller.js).

Instead of uploading a CSV to the API, I'd just like to POST a JSON object (array), then I want to process the data exactly the same as before, and return the result in the API response.
