I've added a new local speech to text (ASR) API. The API is accessible on the local network, through the URL 'http://192.168.0.20:8010', and I've added an API documentation file at `documentation/asr.md`.

Using the documentation file, add a test page on the admin route (controllers/admincontroller.js), for testing the API. Create a simple UI page, with options to upload an audio file for transcription, or record audio directly in the browser for transcription, with an input form set to default values. Then display the response to the user.

No need to integrate with other tools at this stage.
