In the dummy controller (controllers/dummyapicontroller.js) and route (routes/dummyapi.js), please add 2 routes for returning Japan post sample data. One route is responding to a generate label request that return XML, and the other return the label pdf data. There is no need to validate the input data, just return a fixed response for all requests.

Put sample response data in the folder `sample_data`, and use that for responding to all requests.

Expected response (XML, key fields)
- ResultCode=00 on success
- TrackingNumber: EMS tracking number assigned (e.g., EL012345678JP)
- DownLoadUrl: HTTPS URL to the label PDF (valid 1 week) **Make this 'https://my.lentmiien.com/' followed by the fetch label part**
- PostalRate: postage for the shipment
- InsuranceCost: computed ancillary charge if declared/insurance value is provided
Prepare a simple XML file in the sample data folder, following these guidelines.

Also, could I make the URL "/webapi/servlet/WEBAPI" to point to this same router, maybe put the final part "/WEBAPI" in the router file, and put the fetch label under "/webapi/servlet" as well.

The purpose of these API routes are just to return a realistic response, so that I can test my app before switching to the real Japan Post API.

Refer to the file "documentation/japanpost-api.md", for more details on what's expected from the Japan Post API.
