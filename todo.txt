For the `views/ocr_tts_tool.pug` page, I want to have a function for replaying all the TTS generated audio in a job group. So add the audio to the playback queue, from old to new, then play the audios one by one.

An example use would be if I scan the pages of a book and generate TTS for the pages, adding all the jobs to the same job group, then I could later replay the audio files as if reading the book, like an audio book.
