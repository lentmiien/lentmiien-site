The ASR that I've been testing in the admin route works well, so I'd like to transfer this to a regular tool on my website, in it's own route, and I'd like to add a database of transcript audio. So please move this page to a new route/controller in the app, available for all user with appropriate access permissions, just like any other tool on the page.
We can still have 2 source options, upload file or record in browser, but save all uploaded audio files to the `public/audio` folder, do the transcription, and when done, save the filename, transcript text, and some metadata to a new ASR database. Furthermore, I want to add the transcription texts to my embedding database, through the embedding service class (services/embeddingApiService.js), refer to `controllers/ocrcontroller.js` for example how to use the embedding tool. Be sure to add the ASR database to the embedding metadata, and use the regular `embed` function, there is no need to use high quality embedding for this use case.

On the ASR page, add a list of the 10 latest ASR jobs from the database, with pagination for going back in time.

When adding a new route with access privileges, be sure to also add the route identifier string to the `routes` array in `controllers/admincontroller.js`, so that it appear on the admin page for user access management.
