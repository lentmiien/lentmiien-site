# My Personal Website Project

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, a platform where I blend my passion for programming with my personal interests. This project serves not only as my digital portfolio but also as a playground for experimenting with new web technologies and features. From a dynamic chat application inspired by ChatGPT to a comprehensive cooking calendar for meal planning, this website is where I bring my innovative ideas to life.

## Features

- **Chat3:** An enhanced chat feature that supports model selection, branching conversations, and integrates directly with a knowledge database.
- **Cooking Calendar:** Allows for meal planning, managing cooking schedules, and handling family meal requests with links to recipes.
- **Knowledge Database:** A central repository for storing valuable information, including recipes and chat logs, which can be edited and injected into Chat3 conversations.
- **About Page:** Provides insight into my journey as a programmer and the goals of this website.
- **(Planned) Budget Tracker:** A tool for managing personal finances with features for recurring transactions and trend analysis.
- **(Planned) Health Tracker:** A comprehensive system for tracking wellness metrics, including exercise, diet, and health metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Back-End:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose for schema management
- **Front-End:** Pug templates, CSS, JavaScript
- **APIs:** OpenAI for Chat3 enhancements
